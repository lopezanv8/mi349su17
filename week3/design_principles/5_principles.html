  <h1> Principles of Design</h1>

  <h2>Affordance</h2>

  <p> The website I chose to represent the principle of affordance is Pandora.
    I choose Pandora because, as shown in the image,it has characterisitcs that represent
    their intended functions. For example, the pause design, pauses the music playing,
    the double arrow design, skips to the next song, and the thumbs up or thumbs up
    represent whether the user likes or dislikes the song.

  <h2>Mapping</h2>

  <p> The website I chose to represent the principle of mapping is Facebook.
    I choose Facebook because in the image you can view the relationship between the
    image and the controls of Like, Comment, and Share. If you hover over the like, you
    will see different emojis appear, each of these then represent a different
    button that include like, love, haha, wow, sad, and angry.

  <h2>Chunking</h2>

  <p> The website I chose to represent the principle of chunking is Fox News.
    I choose Fox News because the website displays how much information Fox can
    display within a certain area. The information is all one chunk but its slighlty
    seperated so that the viewer can know the difference between each news article.
  </p>

  <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>

  <p> The website I chose to represent the principle of rule of thirds is CNN.
    I choose CNN because as shown in the image, CNN site's has a composition that
    is divided into thirds. There are three different columns and then three rows
    that you can kinda notice by the images within the articles.
  </p>

  <h2>Modularity</h2>

  <p> The website I chose to represent the principle of modularity is Pinterest.
    I choose Pinterest because Pinterest divides their website into rows, the width
    of the rows are all the same, but the length of each component varies depending on the
    image and text of each component. There are small components and large components, allowing
    a combination of all sizes to create the custom design.
